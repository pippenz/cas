## What is CAS?

CAS is a multi-agent coding factory and persistent context system for AI agents. It has two core capabilities:

1. **Factory** — A terminal UI that orchestrates multiple Claude Code instances working in parallel on the same codebase, with a supervisor agent coordinating worker agents across isolated git worktrees.

2. **Context System** — An MCP server that gives agents persistent memory, task tracking, rules, and skills across sessions, backed by SQLite and full-text search.

## Factory

Factory mode turns your terminal into a multi-agent coding operation. A supervisor agent breaks work into tasks while worker agents execute them in parallel — each in its own git worktree to avoid conflicts.

```bash
# Launch the factory TUI
cas

# Launch with 3 workers in isolated worktrees
cas -w 3
```

### How it works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CAS Factory                                            │

├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Shared: CAS database (memories, tasks, rules, skills)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Supervisor** plans work, creates tasks, assigns them to workers, reviews completed work, and merges branches
- **Workers** each get their own git worktree and branch — no merge conflicts during parallel execution
- **Shared context** — all agents read/write the same CAS database for memories, tasks, rules, and coordination messages
- **Built-in terminal multiplexer** — side-by-side or tabbed views of all agent sessions, with a custom VT parser (based on Ghostty)

### Factory features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Worktree isolation** | Each worker gets its own git worktree and branch — parallel edits without conflicts |
| **Task coordination** | Supervisor assigns tasks with dependencies; workers claim, execute, and report back |
| **Live TUI** | Side-by-side or tabbed terminal views of all agents, with real-time status bar |
| **Message passing** | Push-based communication between supervisor and workers via prompt queue |
| **Session management** | Attach, detach, list, and kill factory sessions (`cas attach`, `cas list`, `cas kill`) |
| **Desktop notifications** | Optional alerts when tasks complete or workers hit blockers (`--notify`) |
| **Session recording** | Record terminal sessions for playback (`--record`) |

### When to use Factory

- **Large features** — break an epic into subtasks and parallelize across workers
- **Codebase-wide refactors** — workers modify different files simultaneously without conflicts
- **Multi-step workflows** — tasks with dependencies execute in the right order
- **Code review** — supervisor reviews worker output before merging to the main branch

## Context System

CAS runs as an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that gives your agent persistent context across sessions — 50+ tools for memory, tasks, rules, skills, and search.

### MCP Tools

When your agent has CAS configured, it can:

```
# Remember something across sessions
mcp__cas__memory action=remember content="This project uses Zod for validation"

# Create and track tasks
mcp__cas__task action=create title="Implement auth" priority=1

# Search past context
mcp__cas__search action=search query="error handling patterns"

# Create a rule that auto-syncs to .claude/rules/
mcp__cas__rule action=create content="Always validate input at API boundaries"
```

### What persists

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Learnings, preferences, and observations that survive across sessions |
| **Tasks** | Work items with dependencies, priorities, and structured progress notes |
| **Rules** | Coding conventions that earn trust through use and auto-sync to your editor |
| **Skills** | Reusable agent capabilities with templates and usage tracking |
| **Search** | Fast full-text search (BM25) across all stored context |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://cas.dev/install.sh | sh

# Initialize in your project
cas init

# Launch the factory TUI
cas
```

## Installation

### curl (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cas.dev/install.sh | sh
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap codingagentsystem/cas
brew install cas
```

> **Homebrew users — auto-upgrade Claude Code in the background:**
> If you installed Claude Code via Homebrew, set this env var to let it
> self-upgrade automatically (added in Claude Code 2.1.129):
>
> ```bash
> export CLAUDE_CODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
> ```
>
> Add it to your shell profile (`~/.zprofile`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) to make it
> permanent. Claude Code will run `brew upgrade claude` in the background and
> prompt you to restart.
>
> **This is for Claude Code only — not CAS.** CAS updates via `cas update`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codingagentsystem/cas.git
cd cas
cargo build --release
# Binary at target/release/cas
```

## CLI

```bash
cas                   # Launch the factory TUI
cas -w 3              # Launch with 3 workers
cas serve             # Start MCP server for Claude Code

```

### Claude Code Integration

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`.claude/settings.json` or project `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cas": {
      "command": "cas",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### Data storage

CAS stores all data locally in your project:

```
.cas/
├── cas.db          # SQLite — memories, tasks, rules, skills
├── config.yaml     # Project configuration
└── indexes/
    └── tantivy/    # Full-text search index
```

**Storage tiers:**
- **Project** (`.cas/`) — project-specific context
- **Global** (`~/.config/cas/`) — cross-project preferences and learnings

### Workspace Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cas-cli` | CLI binary, MCP server, and factory TUI |
| `cas-factory` | Multi-agent session lifecycle and coordination |
| `cas-factory-protocol` | Message protocol between supervisor and workers |
| `cas-pty` | PTY management for agent terminal sessions |
| `cas-mux` | Terminal multiplexer layout and rendering |
| `cas-core` | Core logic, hooks, and integrations |
| `cas-store` | SQLite storage layer |
| `cas-search` | Full-text search (BM25 via Tantivy) |
| `cas-mcp` | MCP protocol handlers |
| `cas-types` | Shared data types |
| `cas-code` | Code analysis (tree-sitter) |
| `cas-diffs` | Diff tracking and formatting |
| `cas-recording` | Terminal session recording and playback |
| `ghostty_vt` | Virtual terminal parser (based on Ghostty) |

### Built With

- **Rust** for performance and reliability
- **SQLite** for local-first storage
- **Tantivy** for full-text search (BM25)
- **Ratatui** for the factory TUI
- **Ghostty VT** for terminal emulation
- **rmcp** for MCP protocol support

## Configuration

CAS is configured via `.cas/config.yaml` in your project root. Run `cas config list` to see all options or `cas config describe <key>` for details on any setting.

### Cloud Sync (optional)

CAS works fully offline. Optionally sync your context across devices:

```bash
cas login
cas cloud sync
```

Cloud sync is not required — all core features work locally with SQLite.

### Team Memories (optional)

Share learnings across a team without manual flags. After an admin has
created a team in the CAS Cloud dashboard:

```bash
# One-time setup per machine — UUID from your team dashboard
cas login
cas cloud team set 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

# From now on, every memory captured via mcp__cas__memory
# action=remember (Claude Code) in a Project-scoped, non-Preference
# context automatically dual-enqueues into the team push queue.

# Next sync drains both personal and team queues
cas cloud sync
```

Teammates on a fresh machine see what you've shared with the same
zero-flag setup:

```bash
cas login
cas cloud team set 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
cas cloud team-memories
```

**Backfilling pre-existing memories.** If you had personal entries
before the team was configured, promote them retroactively:

```bash
cas memory share --dry-run --all             # preview
cas memory share --all                       # promote everything eligible
cas memory share --since 7d                  # or just the last week
cas memory share 2026-03-01-1                # or one at a time, by id
cas memory unshare 2026-03-01-1              # reverse — mark as Private
```

Preference-typed and Global-scoped entries always stay personal. To
pause automatic promotion without clearing the team, set
`team_auto_promote: false` in `~/.cas/cloud.json`.
