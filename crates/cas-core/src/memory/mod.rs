//! Memory-specific business logic for CAS.
//!
//! Currently hosts the pre-insert overlap detection workflow shipped by
//! cas-4721. The workflow is defined in the salvaged skill reference at
//! `cas-cli/src/builtins/skills/cas-memory-management/references/overlap-detection.md`
//! and implemented here as a pure-Rust function with no MCP or store
//! dependency — callers fetch candidates and pass them in.
