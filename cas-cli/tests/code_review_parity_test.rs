//! Parity tests against the legacy `code-reviewer` agent (cas-22fa).
//!
//! Validates EPIC cas-0750 success criterion #1: the new multi-persona
//! pipeline catches every red-flag class the legacy `code-reviewer.md`
//! agent caught. The legacy agent was an LLM driven by a single prompt
//! file, so its red-flag set lives in *prose* — there is no programmatic
//! API to compare against. The closest faithful test we can ship is to
//! assert that every legacy red-flag pattern is *named* in at least one
//! persona prompt file in the new skill, on both the claude and codex
//! mirrors. If a worker reads the personas and the pattern is not
//! mentioned, the LLM will not look for it, and the parity claim breaks.
//!
//! The pattern set was inventoried at cas-1e98 close time from the
//! legacy `cas-cli/src/builtins/agents/code-reviewer.md` (now a
//! deprecation stub) and is the source of truth for "no silent
//! regression". Adding a new red flag to the new pipeline is encouraged;
//! removing one without compensating coverage is the failure mode this
//! test exists to catch.
