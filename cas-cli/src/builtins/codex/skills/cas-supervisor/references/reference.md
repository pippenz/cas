# Reference — Action Names, Field Names, Dispatch Pattern

Wrong field names and invalid actions waste dispatch cycles. This section covers exact valid actions and field names.

**Valid `mcp__cs__task` actions** (do not invent others): `create`, `show`, `update`, `start`, `close`, `reopen`, `delete`, `list`, `ready`, `blocked`, `notes`, `dep_add`, `dep_remove`, `dep_list`, `claim`, `release`, `transfer`, `available`, `mine`.

**Valid `mcp__cs__coordination` actions** (do not invent others):
- *Agent*: `register`, `unregister`, `whoami`, `heartbeat`, `agent_list`, `agent_cleanup`, `session_start`, `session_end`, `loop_start`, `loop_cancel`, `loop_status`, `lease_history`, `queue_notify`, `queue_poll`, `queue_peek`, `queue_ack`, `message`, `message_ack`, `message_status`
- *Factory*: `spawn_workers`, `shutdown_workers`, `worker_status`, `worker_activity`, `clear_context`, `my_context`, `sync_all_workers`, `gc_report`, `gc_cleanup`, `epic_status`, `focus_epic`, `remind`, `remind_list`, `remind_cancel`
- *Worktree*: `worktree_create`, `worktree_list`, `worktree_show`, `worktree_cleanup`, `worktree_merge`, `worktree_status`

**`spawn_workers` parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `count` | int | Number of workers to spawn |
| `isolate` | bool | Each worker gets its own git worktree and branch (default false) |
| `worker_names` | string | Comma-separated names for the spawned workers |
| `cli` | string | Explicit CLI backend for this spawn: `claude`, `codex`, or `grok`. If omitted, resolves through factory config, then stock fallback. |
| `model` | string | Explicit model name. Claude: aliases `sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku` (or full id). Codex: plain `gpt-5.5` (no `-codex` suffix). Grok: `grok-4.5` or `grok-composer-2.5-fast` (from `grok models`). Passed as `-m`/`--model`. If omitted, resolves through factory config, then backend stock fallback. |
| `effort` | string | Explicit reasoning effort. CAS vocabulary: `minimal` \| `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh` (alias `x-high`). Mapping: Claude `--effort`; Codex `--config model_reasoning_effort=<v>`; Grok `--reasoning-effort`. If omitted, resolves through factory config, then stock fallback. For multi-step Claude workers prefer `high` as the ceiling — see [model-selection.md](model-selection.md). |

`cli`, `model`, and `effort` are per-spawn controls — they apply to the workers spawned by this call only. Supervisors MUST pass explicit `model=` and `effort=` on every `spawn_workers` call (light Grok Composer may omit `effort=` because the model id is the tier); omitted fields resolve through the config cascade as a fallback and produce an acknowledgement warning. Copy-paste recipes for all three backends: [model-selection.md](model-selection.md#spawn-cookbook-all-three-harnesses).

**Task ID is always `id`** — not `task_id`, `taskId`, or `_id`.

**Priority** is `0=Critical, 1=High, 2=Medium (default), 3=Low, 4=Backlog`. Accepts numeric OR named alias: `priority=1` ≡ `priority="high"`. Other aliases: `critical`, `medium`, `low`, `backlog`, `p0`-`p4`.

**Initial assignment uses `update`, NOT `transfer`:**

```
# CORRECT — initial assignment of an unclaimed task
mcp__cs__task action=update id=cas-abc1 assignee=<worker-name>

# WRONG — transfer requires an ALREADY-CLAIMED lease, otherwise errors
# with "No active lease found". Use transfer only to reassign between
# workers after one has claimed.
mcp__cs__task action=transfer id=cas-abc1 to_agent=<worker>
```

The `transfer` action's target field is `to_agent` (not `assignee`). The `update` action's target field is `assignee` (not `to_agent`). Yes, they disagree. Remember: `update assignee=...` for initial assignment; `transfer to_agent=...` only when reassigning a claimed task.

**Dispatching tasks is a two-step operation.** Sending a coordination message telling a worker to "claim tasks X and Y" does not actually dispatch work — workers react to `assignee` changes on the task, not to message content. Full pattern:

```
# 1. Create
mcp__cs__task action=create title="Fix login bug" priority=high \
  description="..." acceptance_criteria="..."

# 2. Assign (this is what causes the worker to pick it up)
mcp__cs__task action=update id=cas-abc1 assignee=<worker>

# 3. (optional) Provide extra context as a separate message
mcp__cs__coordination action=message target=<worker> \
  summary="cas-abc1 briefing" \
  message="Extra context for cas-abc1: ..."
```

Skipping step 2 leaves the task unassigned — the worker will go idle regardless of how clear the message in step 3 was.

**Coordination messages require BOTH `message` and `summary`:**

```
mcp__cs__coordination action=message target=worker-1 \
  summary="c29a ready for review" \
  message="Please verify cas-c29a. Commit dfe824b on main."
```

Missing either field is a rejection. `summary` is the one-line UI preview; `message` is the full body.

**Urgent / interrupt delivery — course-correct a worker mid-turn (cas-c931):**

Normal messages land only *between* turns: a worker that is mid-turn going down the wrong path finishes the wrong turn before it ever reads "stop, do X instead." For those cases, send an **urgent** message — it breaks the worker's in-flight turn and injects your correction as its next prompt:

```
# Urgent flag on the normal message action
mcp__cs__coordination action=message target=<worker> urgent=true \
  summary="..." message="Stop — you're editing the wrong file. Switch to ..."

# Shorthand — forces urgent even without the flag
mcp__cs__coordination action=interrupt target=<worker> \
  summary="..." message="Stop — wrong approach. Do ... instead."
```

When urgent, the message: breaks the target's in-flight turn (Esc), waits a bounded settle window, then injects the correction as its next prompt; bypasses the Claude Code inbox even in agent-teams mode; forces Critical priority (queue jump) when none is given; skips idle-message dedup; targets the worker **by name**, independent of TUI focus.

**Caveat — urgent DISCARDS the worker's in-flight reasoning / partial work.** Use it ONLY when the worker is demonstrably off the rails (wrong file, wrong approach, ignoring the ticket). For routine nudges or FYIs, use a normal `action=message` (non-disruptive, lands between turns).

**Task notes** parameter is `notes` (plural), not `note`:

```
mcp__cs__task action=notes id=cas-abc1 notes="Progress update" note_type=progress
```

**Booleans** accept native bool, string `"true"`/`"false"`, or numeric `1`/`0`.
