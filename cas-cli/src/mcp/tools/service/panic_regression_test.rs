//! End-to-end regression test for cas-3b51 (EPIC cas-c351).
//!
//! Verifies that the A2 panic catcher applied to every `#[tool]` method on
//! [`super::CasService`] is wired through the real dispatch path, not just
//! the helper module's isolated unit tests. Constructs a real `CasService`
//! backed by a real `CasCore` over a temporary DB, hits
//! `CasService::system` with a `#[cfg(test)]`-guarded action that forces
//! the handler body to `panic!(...)`, and asserts:
//!
//!   * the call surfaces as `McpError{INTERNAL_ERROR, "handler panicked
//!     in 'system': <payload>..."}` rather than killing the process;
//!   * a follow-up call on the **same** `CasService` instance succeeds
//!     and returns non-empty content, proving the service continues
//!     serving after a handler panic;
//!   * the pattern holds for 10 consecutive panics.
//!
//! The test fails if A2 is removed, via either of two collapse paths:
//! deleting `panic_catch::dispatch_with_catch` breaks compilation at
//! every wrap site in mod.rs; deleting the wrap around `system()` alone
//! lets the forced panic unwind through the `.await` into the test thread
//! and the harness records a panicked test. Either shape produces a
//! concrete failure, satisfying the A3 acceptance criterion.
//!
//! The test lives under `cas-cli/src/mcp/tools/service/` rather than
//! `cas-cli/tests/` because integration tests strip `#[cfg(test)]` from
//! the lib, making the injection branch in `system()` unreachable from
//! that tree. A unit test inside the crate sees `#[cfg(test)]` active.
