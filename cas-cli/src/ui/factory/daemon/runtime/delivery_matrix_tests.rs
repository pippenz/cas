//! Cross-harness delivery routing matrix (cas-47b7 — verification half of EPIC
//! cas-ca04; cas-4484 — full 3×3 bidirectional closure for EPIC cas-873a).
//!
//! cas-b68a's own unit tests (in `delivery.rs`) cover the routing *primitives*
//! one argument-pair at a time. This module pins the **end-to-end semantic
//! matrix** the EPIC acceptance criteria are written against: for every
//! `(supervisor_harness, worker_harness)` factory shape and **both directions**
//! of a message (downward `target=worker`, upward `target=supervisor`), the
//! recipient-aware routing must choose the right channel, honor the PTY
//! readiness gate, and frame codex recipients.
//!
//! This is a pure regression test over `choose_channel` /
//! `requires_pty_readiness_gate` / `pty_payload_needs_framing` — it never
//! touches a live MCP server, a PTY, or a Teams inbox (per the live-MCP testing
//! convention: fixture-driven in `cargo test`, live behavior smoke-tested
//! manually and documented separately).
//!
//! The matrix deliberately re-derives the *expected* answer from first
//! principles inside each row so a future change to the routing logic that
//! happens to keep the primitives self-consistent but breaks a real factory
//! shape still trips a red cell here.
//!
//! cas-4484 closes the STATIC evidence gap left by cas-474b: Grok-supervisor
//! mixed-worker pairings (and the remaining codex-sup / grok-worker cell) are
//! first-class automated shapes, bringing the matrix to all 9 pairings × 2
//! directions = 18 direction-specific contracts.
