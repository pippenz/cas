//! Recipient-aware message delivery (cas-b68a).
//!
//! Every supervisor→worker (and worker→supervisor / director→agent) message must
//! reach the recipient over a channel the recipient can actually read:
//!
//! - A **Claude** agent in a native Agent-Teams factory reads its inbox files, so
//!   delivery goes through [`TeamsManager::write_to_inbox`].
//! - A **Codex** agent is *not* a member of the Claude team and never polls an
//!   inbox; the only channel it can receive is a direct PTY write
//!   ([`Mux::inject`]) performed by the daemon that holds its PTY master.
//!
//! The historical bug was that every delivery site branched on whether the
//! **supervisor** was in teams mode (`self.teams.is_some()`), not on the
//! **recipient's** harness. A Codex worker under a Claude supervisor therefore had
//! its messages written to an inbox it could never read, and the PTY path — its
//! only viable channel — was never taken. This module centralises the routing
//! decision so it can no longer drift per call site.
