//! Team auto-promotion filter policy.
//!
//! Implements the T1 decision in `docs/requests/team-memories-filter-policy.md`
//! — given an entity and (indirectly) a configured team, decide whether the
//! syncing store wrapper should dual-enqueue the write to the team push queue
//! in addition to the personal queue.
//!
//! The predicate is per-entity-type because `Entry` has a `Preference` carve-out
//! that does not apply to `Rule` / `Skill` / `Task`. Each `eligible_for_team_*`
//! function is pure — no I/O, no config reads — and is cheap enough to run on
//! every write.
//!
//! Caller-side protocol (per filter-policy Decision 1):
//!
//! 1. Resolve `cloud_config.active_team_id()` — `None` means no team configured
//!    OR `team_auto_promote = Some(false)` kill-switch. Skip team enqueue.
//! 2. Apply the per-type predicate to the entity. `false` means the rule or
//!    explicit override says "stay personal".
//! 3. Only if both pass, enqueue the team row.
//!
//! ## Delete fan-out rationale
//!
//! `queue_delete` in each syncing wrapper dual-enqueues unconditionally when
//! a team is configured, bypassing the eligibility predicate. We don't have
//! the entity at delete time to run the predicate — the caller gave us only
//! an id. Over-pushing a delete for an entity that was never team-enqueued
//! is cheap (the server has no row to touch and the DELETE is idempotent);
//! under-pushing would leave stale team rows forever. Trade over-push for
//! correctness. Best-effort matches the personal path's contract.
