# Contributing to CAS

## Factory cloud client (disabled by default)

The factory daemon ships with a live-stream WebSocket client
(`cas-cli/src/ui/factory/daemon/cloud_client.rs`) that pushes factory state,
events, and pane output to a Phoenix-framework endpoint
(`/socket/websocket`). That endpoint is **not** implemented on the current
cloud backend (petra-stella-cloud is Next.js on Vercel, which can't host
long-lived Phoenix channels) and the feature it fronts — the Hetzner Slack
bridge / web terminal — is paused (see `project_claude_code_account_banned`).

The client is therefore gated behind a config flag and **disabled by
default**. Flip it on in `.cas/cloud.json`:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://your-phoenix-capable-host",
  "token": "…",
  "factory_cloud_client_enabled": true
}
```

Re-enable only when a Phoenix-capable backend is reachable. The REST-based
cloud syncer (`cas-cli/src/cloud/syncer/`) is independent of this flag and
always runs when logged in.

## Canonical install path

CAS must be installed to **one** location: `~/.local/bin/cas`. Any other
location (`/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`) creates silent
duplicates: PATH-order changes (interactive zsh vs. a systemd service, or a
subagent invoking `cas` via absolute path) can promote a stale copy and
silently reintroduce fixed bugs.

- `scripts/cas-install.sh` installs to `~/.local/bin/cas` and warns about any
  other `cas` binaries it finds on PATH.
- On startup, `cas` itself scans PATH and emits a single-line stderr warning
  when duplicates with diverging mtimes are present. Silence it with
  `CAS_SUPPRESS_DUPLICATE_WARNING=1`, or force it on in non-TTY contexts with
  `CAS_WARN_DUPLICATES=1`. Hooks, `cas serve`, and `cas factory` are never
  warned.
- If you previously installed via `cargo install cas` or a distro package,
  remove those copies so only `~/.local/bin/cas` remains.

## Adding Features

**New CLI command**: Add variant to `Commands` enum in `cas-cli/src/cli/mod.rs`, create handler file in `cli/`, add integration test in `tests/cli_test.rs`.

**New MCP tool**: Add handler in `cas-cli/src/mcp/tools/core/` (data tools) or `cas-cli/src/mcp/tools/service/` (orchestration tools). Request types go in `cas-cli/src/mcp/tools/types/`. Register in the tool list via the `CasService` impl.

**New migration**: Create file in `cas-cli/src/migration/migrations/` following naming convention `m{NNN}_{table}_{description}.rs`. Add to the `MIGRATIONS` array in `migrations/mod.rs`. Each migration needs: unique sequential ID, up SQL, and a detect query. See `cas-cli/docs/MIGRATIONS.md` for full details. Migration ID ranges: Entries 1-50, Rules 51-70, Skills 71-90, Agents 91-110, Entities/Worktrees 111+, Verification 131+, Loops/Events 151+.

## Testing

Integration tests are in `cas-cli/tests/`. Key test files:
- `cli_test.rs` — CLI command integration tests
- `mcp_tools_test.rs` — MCP tool handler tests
- `mcp_protocol_test.rs` — MCP protocol compliance
- `factory_server_test.rs` — Factory WebSocket server tests
- `distributed_factory_test.rs` — Multi-agent factory tests
- `proptest_test.rs` — Property-based tests
- `e2e_test.rs` / `e2e/` — End-to-end tests

Dev dependencies include: `insta` (snapshot testing), `wiremock` (HTTP mocking), `rstest` (parametrized tests), `proptest` (property-based), `criterion` (benchmarks), `cas-tui-test` (TUI testing).

## Skill & Rule Sync

CAS auto-syncs rules to `.claude/rules/` and skills to `.claude/skills/` as SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter. The sync logic lives in `cas-cli/src/sync/`. Rule promotion: Draft -> Proven via `mcp__cas__rule action=helpful`.

## Releasing

### Version policy

- `cas-cli/Cargo.toml` version is the release version (currently 2.0.0).
- Internal crates (`cas-core`, `cas-mux`, `cas-mcp-proxy`, etc.) stay at `0.1.0` unless published separately.
- **Patch** (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, doc updates, performance improvements.
- **Minor** (x.Y.0): New features, new CLI commands, new MCP tools.
- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes — cloud protocol changes, CLI flag removals, MCP tool schema changes.

### Breaking changes

These require a major version bump:
- Cloud sync protocol changes (push/pull shape, endpoint paths)
- CLI flag or subcommand removals/renames
- MCP tool parameter schema changes (field renames, type changes)
- Migration format changes that break older DBs without a migration path

### Steps to cut a release

1. Update version in `cas-cli/Cargo.toml`
2. Add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format)
3. Update the comparison links at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Commit: `chore(release): bump to vX.Y.Z`
5. Tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`
6. Push: `git push && git push --tags`
7. Create GitHub release: `gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes`
