# Resolution (cas-c145, 2026-07-11)

**Status:** Fixed in this branch (`factory/hv-grok-merge`).

## Characterization (pre-fix)

1. WorkerIdle + AwaitingMerge/MERGE REQUIRED director prompt only said "resolve the rejection" — no factory branch, epic target, or merge next-action (`cas-cli/src/ui/factory/director/prompts.rs`).
2. Event reachability already worked (cas-627f); the **content** of the supervisor nudge was the gap, not delivery.
3. `GROK_SUPERVISOR_INSTRUCTIONS` (`crates/cas-pty/src/pty.rs`) mentioned review/merge generically with no merge-queue-before-user-chat priority (Grok lacks SessionStart additionalContext, so `--rules` is the boot surface).
4. Supervisor skill "never poll / end turn" lacked a complementary push-based merge-drain rule, so free-form user chat could outrank a non-empty merge queue.

## Fix

| Layer | Change |
|-------|--------|
| Director auto-prompt | MERGE REQUIRED / AwaitingMerge idle → actionable merge-queue prompt: task id, `factory/<worker>`, epic target branch, `epic_status` + list awaiting_merge, merge steps, re-close, explicit no-poll |
| Grok `--rules` | `GROK_SUPERVISOR_INSTRUCTIONS` now prioritizes merge-queue drain before free-form chat |
| Supervisor skill twins | Push-based merge drain folded into "Never monitor, poll" hard rule; Phase 3 workflow documents AwaitingMerge steps (Claude/Grok/Codex prefixes) |

Close-gate merge semantics were **not** modified (owned by sibling tasks).

## Proof

```
cargo test -p cas --lib ui::factory::director::prompts::tests::test_c145
cargo test -p cas --lib ui::factory::director::prompts::tests::test_worker_idle
cargo test -p cas --lib ui::factory::director::prompts::tests::test_09d0_worker_idle_awaiting_merge
cargo test -p cas-pty --lib test_pty_config_grok_supervisor
cargo test -p cas --lib test_supervisor_guidance
```

All focused tests above pass. After supervisor merge, workers re-close as before (existing verification_flow coverage for post-merge close).

# BUG: Grok supervisor misses `awaiting_merge` / MERGE REQUIRED and stalls the factory

**Label:** `grok-supervisor` · `factory` · `awaiting_merge` · `merge-queue` · **P0**

Please treat this as a **cas-src / Grok Build factory harness** bug, not an Ozer product bug.

---

## Situation (plain language)

We ran a normal CAS factory epic on Ozer with **Grok Build as supervisor** and **Grok workers**.

Workers did their jobs correctly:

1. Implemented the task
2. Committed + pushed `factory/<worker>`
3. Attempted `cas__task action=close`
4. Got **MERGE REQUIRED** → task moved to **`awaiting_merge`**
5. Messaged the supervisor: “merge us into the epic”
6. Went idle (lease released) — which is **correct**

The **Grok supervisor failed its job**:

- Did **not** merge factory branches into the epic when workers asked
- Answered user chat (“is it on staging?”) while the merge queue was non-empty
- Left the factory looking like “**zero workers are working**” because workers were correctly blocked on the supervisor merge gate
- Only merged after the human escalated multiple times

Human quotes from the same session (evidence of operator impact):

1. “you keep missing messages to merge”
2. “zero workers are working”
3. “supervisor merges to epic, why dont you know how to do your job?”

This is **not** worker death. PIDs were alive, heartbeats fresh. The bottleneck was **supervisor triage**: merge messages were not treated as top priority.

---

## What the supervisor is supposed to do

When a worker hits `MERGE REQUIRED` / `awaiting_merge`:

1. `epic_status` / inspect factory commits
2. Merge (FF / merge / cherry-pick) `factory/*` → `epic/*`
3. Push epic
4. Tell worker to re-close **or** supervisor-close after merge if worker is idle
5. Assign next ready task

That is Phase 3 of factory workflow. Grok supervisor repeatedly skipped it.

| Date | 2026-07-10 |
| Project | Ozer Health (`/home/pippenz/Petrastella/ozer`) |
| Epic | **cas-4c77** — General dosha recipes — dual-mode generation + standalone recipes page |
| Epic branch | `epic/general-dosha-recipes-dual-mode-generation-standal-cas-4c77` |
| Factory session (CAS) | `ozer-happy-cobra-8` (focus epic cas-4c77) |
| Supervisor agent | `zealous-koala-34` (Grok Build, primary) |
| Supervisor session id | `0869ce7c-11c1-4c74-baf7-e068e7f69781` |
| Workers | `recipe-be` (session `b023b0a7-eeee-4315-a106-2d9c17f1534d`), `recipe-fe` (session `aa6a1071-d8c5-4f99-b874-7b182e96cb36`) |
| Worker model | `cli=grok model=grok-4.5 effort=medium isolate=true` |
| CAS version | `2.27.0 (9f86e08-dirty 2026-07-10)` |

### Tasks stuck on merge gate (until human forced action)

| Task | Worker | Commit | Status while stalled |
|------|--------|--------|----------------------|
| cas-8eff (backend general recipes API) | recipe-be | `5ec4e032` | `awaiting_merge`, unmerged=1 |
| cas-caec (useRecipeGeneration dual-mode) | recipe-fe | `ea496beb` | `awaiting_merge`, unmerged=1 |
| cas-a5ff (`/recipes` page) | recipe-fe | `c154b6eb` | `awaiting_merge`, unmerged=1 after prior work |

Eventually merges did land (supervisor acted late under pressure). Epic tip after recovery: **`c154b6eb`**.

## Expected vs actual

| Expected | Actual |
|----------|--------|
| Worker close → MERGE REQUIRED → supervisor merges same turn or next injected turn | Supervisor ignores merge messages for multiple human turns |
| `epic_status` unmerged>0 is fire-drill priority | Supervisor answers “is it on staging?” while unmerged=1 |
| Workers idle only after next assignment | Workers idle because merge gate blocked close; looks like “nobody is working” |
| No human babysitting of merge queue | Human had to yell three times |

---

## Suspected root causes (for cas-src)

1. **Grok supervisor boot / skill** does not force “scan `awaiting_merge` + `epic_status` before any user reply.”
2. Worker merge messages may not inject as **URGENT** supervisor turns (or Grok ends turn without draining the merge queue).
3. “End turn after assign / don’t poll” guidance without a complementary **start-of-turn merge-queue mandatory scan**.
4. No durable reminder while focused epic has `unmerged > 0`.
5. Possible Grok vs Claude factory harness gap: Claude supervisors may get better merge nudges.

---

## Suggested fix (product / harness)

1. Every Grok supervisor turn **must** begin with:

   ```
   cas__coordination action=epic_status id=<focused-epic>
   cas__task action=list status=awaiting_merge
   ```

   If unmerged > 0 or any awaiting_merge → **merge before answering the user.**

2. Emit first-class factory event `task_awaiting_merge` that injects an URGENT prompt with factory SHA + epic branch pre-filled.

3. Auto-remind supervisor while focused epic has stranded factory commits.

4. Regression test / fixture: simulate MERGE REQUIRED message → assert merge step before free-form chat.

---

## Out of scope

- Ozer recipe product code (that epic’s implementation was fine)
- Squash-merge anchor false negative (separate: `BUG-awaitingmerge-anchor-squash-merge-2026-07-09.md`) — this incident used normal FF merges; the gate was **correct**, the supervisor just didn’t run merges

## Contact / context

- Filed by: Grok supervisor session on Ozer at operator request, 2026-07-10
- Operator: human driving factory for epic cas-4c77
- Related ozer CAS tracker task: **cas-760e**

**Please pick this up in cas-src.** Fix belongs in Grok factory supervisor prompt/skill/harness so merge-queue stalls cannot recur without a human screaming.
