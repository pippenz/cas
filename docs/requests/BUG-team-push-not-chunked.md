# Team push bundles all entity types into one unbounded request → 413 on the cloud

`cas cloud sync` consistently fails the team-push leg with `413 Payload too large` once the team queue grows past ~2 MB compressed. Personal push on the same run succeeds because it chunks; team push does not chunk at all.

## Affected version

`cas 1.95.0` (observed in the field on 2026-06-01).

## Symptom

User runs `cas cloud sync` after some offline time. Output excerpt:

```
✓ Push complete
    Entries: 0 inserted, 626 updated
    Tasks:   0 inserted, 1415 updated
    Rules:   0 inserted, 78 updated
    Skills:  0 inserted, 3 updated
    Events:  91 inserted, 9909 updated
    File changes: 22 inserted, 5312 updated
  ⚠ Team push encountered 1 error(s); items re-queued for next sync
    - Team push failed with status 413: {"error":"Payload too large"}
✓ Pull complete
...
✓ Team pull: 626 entries, 1421 tasks, 78 rules, 3 skills (2128 total)
```

Personal push (the first block) and team pull both succeed. Team push always 413s and the items get re-queued — so every subsequent `cas cloud sync` repeats the same failure forever, because the queue never drains and the next bundle is the same size or larger.

## Root cause — confirmed in source

The cloud's body-size guard lives at `petra-stella-cloud/lib/gzip.ts`:

```ts
export const MAX_BODY_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024;       // 10 MB decompressed
export const MAX_COMPRESSED_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024;  // 2 MB compressed
```

It throws `PayloadTooLargeError` (→ HTTP 413 in the route handler). This is below Vercel's 4.5 MB platform body limit on purpose; raising it server-side is a separate cloud-side ticket but does not solve the architectural problem.

The asymmetry between personal and team push:

| | Personal (`cas-cli/src/cloud/syncer/push.rs`) | Team (`cas-cli/src/cloud/syncer/team_push.rs`) |
|---|---|---|
| Per-entity-type requests | **Yes** — one `push_batch` call per entity type | **No** — single bundled `payload` map |
| Sub-batch by byte budget | **Yes** — `split_into_sub_batches(...)` uses `config.max_payload_bytes` | **No** |
| Per-request size | Bounded by `config.max_payload_bytes` | **Unbounded** — grows with queue depth |

Specifically, `team_push.rs:35-101` stuffs all 12 entity types (`entries`, `tasks`, `rules`, `skills`, `sessions`, `verifications`, `events`, `prompts`, `file_changes`, `commit_links`, `agents`, `worktrees`) plus `project_canonical_id` and `client_version` into one `serde_json::Map`, gzips it once at `team_push.rs:151-153`, and POSTs once at `team_push.rs:160-165`. There is no equivalent of `split_into_sub_batches` on this path.

Failure handling is correct (`team_push.rs:229-240` re-enqueues every drained item on failure), so **no data is lost** — but the bundle stays the same size or grows on the next attempt, so the failure is sticky.

## The fix

Make team push mirror personal push:

1. **Iterate entity types instead of bundling.** For each non-empty entity type vector in the grouped result, build a single-type `payload` (just `{ "<type>": [...], "project_canonical_id": ..., "client_*": ... }`), the way `push_batch` already does on the personal path.
2. **Sub-batch by byte budget.** Reuse the existing `split_into_sub_batches` (or factor a shared helper) so each per-type request is capped by `config.max_payload_bytes`. The existing JSON-size accounting and 256-byte overhead heuristic should port over unchanged.
3. **Per-sub-batch POST + retry.** Match the `push_sub_batch` retry/backoff shape from personal push: 3 attempts, `400-499` short-circuits, transport errors retry. On terminal failure, re-enqueue **only the items in the failing sub-batch**, not the entire team queue (current code re-enqueues the whole drained set on the first failure).
4. **Aggregate `SyncResult` counts across sub-batches** the same way personal push does, so the user-facing summary remains a single line.

Deletes (`send_team_deletes`) are already one-per-entity and don't have this problem.

### Pseudo-shape

```rust
// team_push.rs — replace lines ~35-227 with something like:
for entity_type in ALL_TEAM_ENTITY_TYPES {
    let items = grouped.take(entity_type); // entries / tasks / etc.
    if items.is_empty() { continue; }

    for sub_batch in split_into_sub_batches(items, config.max_payload_bytes) {
        let payload = build_team_sub_batch_payload(
            entity_type, sub_batch, &project_id, client_version,
        );
        match push_team_sub_batch(team_id, entity_type, &payload, token) {
            Ok(resp) => result.merge(resp),
            Err(e) => {
                re_enqueue_sub_batch(&sub_batch, team_id);
                last_error = Some(e);
                // keep going for other entity types? or break? — match personal push policy
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The "what to do on partial failure" policy (continue other entity types vs. abort and re-queue everything) should match whatever personal push currently does. Reading `push.rs:45-175` suggests personal push **continues to the next entity type on per-batch failure** — team push should do the same.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **No single team-push request exceeds `config.max_payload_bytes` post-serialization** (pre-gzip).
2. **A backed-up team queue with ~10 MB of total upserts drains cleanly** in N successful smaller requests, with the same final result counts as a single bundled request would have produced if the cap hadn't tripped.
3. **Per-sub-batch failure re-enqueues only the failing sub-batch's items**, not the entire drained team queue.
4. **`SyncResult` totals** (`pushed_entries`, `pushed_tasks`, etc.) sum correctly across sub-batches.
5. **Personal push regression check:** `push.rs` behavior is unchanged (this BUG only touches team push).
6. **No data loss** on transient 5xx or transport errors — same re-enqueue guarantee as today, just at sub-batch granularity.
7. **E2E test against a mock cloud** with `MAX_COMPRESSED_SIZE = 2 MB` (the current production cap) that intentionally enqueues ~5 MB of team upserts: must succeed in multiple requests without 413.

## Demo statement (Definition of Done)

Starting from a CAS instance with several MB of pending team-scope upserts in the sync queue, `cas cloud sync` completes the team-push leg in multiple smaller HTTP requests, returns "Push complete" with the full sentinel counts, and **no `413 Payload too large` line appears** in the output.

## What the cloud side is doing in parallel

Petra Stella Cloud will raise `MAX_COMPRESSED_SIZE` from 2 MB to ~4 MB (and `MAX_BODY_SIZE` 10 MB → 20 MB) as a short-term safety net for existing CLI builds, staying safely under Vercel's 4.5 MB platform body limit. This is **not** a substitute for the CLI fix — a sufficiently backed-up queue will still blow past 4 MB. Bundling is the architectural defect; chunking is the architectural fix.
