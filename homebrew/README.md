# Homebrew Tap for CAS

This directory contains the Homebrew formula for CAS.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Tap Repository

The canonical tap repository is `codingagentsystem/homebrew-cas` on GitHub.

### 2. Add the Formula

Copy `cas.rb` to the tap repository:

```
homebrew-cas/
└── Formula/
    └── cas.rb
```

### 3. Update SHA256 Hashes

After a release, update the formula with the correct hashes:

```bash
./update-formula.sh 0.2.0
```

Then commit and push to the tap repository.

## User Installation

Once the tap is set up, users can install CAS via:

```bash
# Add the tap (one-time)
brew tap codingagentsystem/cas

# Install CAS
brew install cas

# Or in one command
brew install codingagentsystem/cas/cas
```

## Updating the Formula

When releasing a new version:

1. Create and push the git tag (triggers release workflow)
2. Wait for GitHub Actions to build and publish the release
3. Run `./update-formula.sh <version>` to update hashes
4. Commit and push the updated formula to the tap repository

## Alternative: Automated Updates

For automated formula updates, consider adding a GitHub Action to the tap repository that:

1. Watches for new releases in the main CAS repo
2. Downloads the new binaries and computes SHA256
3. Updates the formula and creates a PR
